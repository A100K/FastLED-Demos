FastLED-Demos
=============

This is just a quick and dirty posting of a few demo sequences for FastLED 2.1 and above. 

Some I made, others I've found on the Internet and modified.

The template for the sequences is under aattemplate.



FastLED is available from: http://fastled.io/

Download FastLED 2.1 library from this GitHub branch at: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/FastLED2.1
