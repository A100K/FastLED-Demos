Here's some demo sequences for FastLED 2.1 (and above) for a single strand of RGB LED's, such as WS2811 or WS2812B. Some I made,
others I've found on the Internet and modified. Each should compile and run separately. I've tested them on an Arduino UNO and
Nano 3.0.

In the future, I hope to restructure this into sequences that:

* just run
* are sound responsive with just a microphone
* are sound responsive with msgeq7 spectrum analyzer chip
* support some form of input
* a comprehensive all-in-one sequence (that I'm currently working on)


The template for the sequences is called aattemplate.
