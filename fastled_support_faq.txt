FastLED Support FAQ

By: Andrew Tuline

Date: July, 2015


I've made a LOT of mistakes over the past couple of years, and thought I'd pass along some of the things I've seen and done.



 

Q. My LED's are the wrong colour.

A. Run RGB Calibrate as found at:

https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/RGBCalibrate

You could be using Neopixels, which typically have a colour ordering of GRB. Instead of using:

FastLED.addLeds<NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN>

try:

LEDS.addLeds<WS2812, LED_DT, RGB>     or
LEDS.addLeds<WS2812, LED_DT, GRB>


In the case of APA102, try:

LEDS.addLeds<APA102, LED_DT, LED_CK, BGR>



Things we've seen:

- Connecting to the wrong data/clock pin.
- Incorrect LEDS.addLeds definition.
- Flaky wiring/breadboard.
- The wrong version of the library being used (wasn't up to date).
- Some strips/code/microcontrollers need the development version of the library (currently at 3.1, which is NOT the default).
- Incorrectly named library.
- Duplicate library.
- Library placed in wrong location.
- Not enough power/current available.
- Too high (or low) of a voltage being used.
- Noisy power supplies.
- Trying to power too many LED's from the Arduino 5V line.
- Connecting to Dout instead of Din.
- Grounds not tied together.
- Blown LED's (see voltage above).
- Memory leakage, i.e. referring to leds[NUM_LEDS] as opposed to leds[NUM_LEDS-1].
- Wrong colours (as in Neopixels).
- Make sure you're not using a 12V led strip.
- Your board may not yet be supported.
- Your code just does NOT work (yet). Have you tried known working code?
- Trying to support too many LED's. (Learn to walk before you can run).
- IR doesn't work with WS2812's. No it doesn't. Try APA102's.
 
 

Q. I've tried the above and it still doesn't work. Help!!!

A. There could be loads of reasons, so let's gather information. Please provide details:

- What kind of LED's you're using.
- What board you're using.
- How it's all powered up.
- What version of the FastLED library you're using.
- What version of Arduino IDE you're using.
- What OS you're building from.
- A circuit diagram/layout (try using Fritzing to show it).
- A copy of your .ino file (copy it to www.pastebin.com).
- Essentially, give us EVERYTHING in excruciating detail.
- Provide specifics on how/where it's all being powered up.
- That would be pins, voltages, power supply used. . . everything.
- Check out "things we've seen" (below).
- Try and remove all the superfluous code and minimize the amount of code that exhibits the issue.

A. Oh, and triple check EVERYTHING. Again!

If you ask a question online and later get it resolved, please have the courtesy and post what the solution was.

 

Q. My FastLED .ino file gives a (long assed) compile error.

A. Make sure you are using (the most recent update of) FastLED.
A. Some routines may require the LATEST development version (currently 3.1). Get it.
A. Make sure you've renamed the library to just FastLED.
A. Re-install the library just to be sure.
A. Check your code to make sure it's correct. 
A. Post a copy of your code onto pastebin.com and ask for some assistance with it. Please remove the non-relevant portions if you can.

 

Q. I want to use a LOT of LED's. What do I need to do?

A. Remember that at full brightness, each LED can take up to 60mA of current.
A. If you need to limit the current, consider using the power management capabilities of FastLED.
A. Depending on the brightness, if you're running more than about 30 LED's, you should be using a dedicated power source for them You shouldn't be powering the Arduino with 5V through the barrel connector.
A. Just make sure that all of the grounds are tied together. Robustly.
A. You should put a 1000uf capacitor between Vcc and Gnd near the strip.
A. Add a 330 ohm resistor between the data lines and the strip.
A. Add a 10K ohm resistor between the data lines and Gnd. 
A. Here's an interesting article:

A. Test the whole thing about on a small scale first, so you can isolate power/size issues from basic functionality.

 

Q. My Arduino is not recognized? What do I do?

A. Try a different Arduino.
A. Try a different cable.
A. Try a short cable.
A. Remove the LED strip from the Arduino.
A. Are you using an Arduino clone? With a clone FTDI chip? If so, please Google search for 'FTDI fix'.
 

 


When designing complicated projects:

- Break it down into individual components (i.e. buttons, IR, LED's).
- Create test jigs and programs for each component.
- Slowly combine the functionality and test again.
- Make sure you incorporate lots of testing.
- Learn to use git for version control.
- Be prepared to throw it all out and start from scratch with your newly acquired knowledge.
